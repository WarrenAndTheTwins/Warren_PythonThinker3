## Recap 1: Pseudocode (Recycling logic)
Task: Write down the steps on how to solve the problem below

Design pseudocode for a recycling robot that sorts items
into bins for glass, plastic, and paper. The robot should
check each item's material and place it in the correct bin.
<!-- 1. move the elbow joint of a robotic arm towards a given material
2. adjust for height, width, and length of material
3. use phalange joints to grab material
4. move elbow and/or shoulder joints to move material over a sensor
5. consult algorithm on which material it is
6. algorithm consults databases and uses AI to differentiate materials
7. algorithm sends answer to robotic arm
8. arm receives answer, adjusts elbow joint to place material over the bin it goes in
(8.5. if none of them, dropkick into space)
9. use phalange joints to open hand and drop object
10. repeat -->
<!-- 1. check material
2. if glass, place over glass bin, drop
3. if plastic, place over plastic bin, drop
4. if paper, place over papetr bin, drop -->
